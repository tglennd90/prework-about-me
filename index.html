      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer for a few reasons. As I am transitioning in to a new stage of life, I have found that I enjoy new challenges. I am a complete beginner to the world of computers and I feel a certain sense of excitement while learning. I also am aware that computers are the future, and in my current line of work job security gets less permanent with each passing year. I hope that my love for gaming combined with knowledge and skills learned in this bootcamp that I can find a new career that is both exciting and secure, allowing me to provide for my family while also pursuing a career that I can love and enjoy each day.</p>
